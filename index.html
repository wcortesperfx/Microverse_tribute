          <li><strong>2000:</strong> Messi was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency, which made him much shorter than his peers.

          <li><strong>2006:</strong> Messi played in his first FIFA World Cup with the Argentine national team, but the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals. </li>
          <li><strong>2009:</strong> Messi won his first Ballon d'Or, which is awarded to the best player in the world, and he helped Barcelona win the treble (La Liga, Copa del Rey, and UEFA Champions League). </li>
          <li><strong>2010:</strong> Messi won his second Ballon d'Or and helped Argentina reach the quarterfinals of the FIFA World Cup in South Africa. </li>
          <li><strong>2011:</strong> Messi won his third Ballon d'Or, and he helped Barcelona win the UEFA Champions League and La Liga titles. </li>

          <li><strong>2014:</strong> Messi helped Argentina reach the final of the FIFA World Cup in Brazil, but the team lost to Germany. </li>
          <li><strong>2015:</strong> Messi won his fifth Ballon d'Or, and he helped Barcelona win the treble for the second time in his career. </li>
          <li><strong>2016:</strong> Messi announced his retirement from international football after Argentina lost to Chile in the Copa America final, but he later reversed his decision. </li>
          <li><strong>2019:</strong> Messi won his sixth Ballon d'Or, surpassing Cristiano Ronaldo's record of five, and he helped Barcelona win La Liga. </li>
          <li><strong>2020:</strong> Messi expressed his desire to leave Barcelona, but he ultimately decided to stay for another year due to a contractual dispute. </li>
